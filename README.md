# html5-web-storage-indexeddb-file-system_ad_ps

Learn to use HTML5 to persist data on the client using Web Storage (local and session storage), the client-side object database known as IndexedDB and the in-browser file system. In this course you are introduced to each persistence medium and will learn to abstract away the complexities of using the raw APIs. Discussion of each technology also includes a "real-life" sample to demonstrate how you can use capabilities shown in this course in context of an application scenario.
